Here’s your explanation rewritten in a **short, clear, and understandable** way:

# ✨ **Constructor Injection using XML Configuration**

1. We created two Java classes:
    - `Specification` (contains `make` and `model`).
    - `Car` (depends on `Specification` through its constructor).

2. Then, in the XML file (`beans.xml`):
    - We defined a **bean** for `Specification` with properties `make` and `model`.
    - We defined a **bean** for `Car` and used `<constructor-arg ref="carSpecification"/>` to inject the `Specification` bean into `Car` through its constructor.

3. In the `App` (main class):
    - We created an `ApplicationContext` and loaded the `beans.xml`.
    - Using `context.getBean("myCar")`, we got the `Car` object with the `Specification` automatically injected.

# ✨ **Key Points to Remember**

| Step | Action |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | Define the dependent class (`Specification`) and the main class (`Car`) |
| 2 | In XML, first define the `Specification` bean |
| 3 | Then define the `Car` bean and use `<constructor-arg ref="carSpecification"/>` to inject |
| 4 | In the main method, load the XML and get the `Car` bean from context |
