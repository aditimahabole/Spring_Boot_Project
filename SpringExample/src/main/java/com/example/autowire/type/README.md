Here are the **important points** about `autowire="byType"` based on your code:

---

### ✅ **Key Points for `autowire="byType"`**

1. **Type matters, not name**
    - Spring injects the bean based on **type match**, not bean ID or setter name.
    - Field: `private Specification specification1;`  
      Setter: `setSpecification1(Specification specification)`

2. **Only one bean of that type must exist**
    - If multiple beans of type `Specification` exist, Spring throws an error:
      > `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`

3. **Setter name can be anything**
    - It doesn’t need to be `setSpecification1()` — Spring just looks at the **parameter type**.

4. **Field name is ignored**
    - Even if the field is named `specification1` and bean ID is something else (`specification1`, `spec1`, etc.), it **doesn’t matter**.

5. **Bean ID is irrelevant**
    - You can name the bean anything (`spec1`, `toyotaSpec`, etc.).

6. **If you need multiple beans**, use `@Qualifier` (in annotation-based config).

7. **Avoid duplicate beans** of the same type in XML unless you want to autowire manually using `ref`.

### ❌ What to Avoid

- Defining **multiple beans of same type** in XML when using `byType`.
  ```xml
  <bean id="spec1" class="Specification"/>
  <bean id="spec2" class="Specification"/>
  ```
  ⛔ Will cause ambiguity.
