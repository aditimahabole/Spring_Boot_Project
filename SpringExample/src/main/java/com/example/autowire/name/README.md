## ‚úÖ What You Did:
You are using this in your `Car` class:

```java
private Specification specification1;
```

And a setter:

```java
public void setSpecification1(Specification specification) { ... }
```

In the XML:

```xml
<bean id="specification1" class="com.example.autowire.name.Specification" />
<bean id="myCar" class="com.example.autowire.name.Car" autowire="byName" />
```

This **works** because:
- The **field name is `specification1`**
- The **bean id is also `specification1`**
- The setter is `setSpecification1(...)`

Spring matches the **field name** with the **bean id** and then calls the **setter with matching name** (`setSpecification1`) to inject the bean.

---

## ‚ùå What You Tried:

You changed this:

```java
public void setSpecification1(Specification specification) { ... }
```

to:

```java
public void setSpecification123(Specification specification) { ... }
```

Then it stopped working.  
Why? Because Spring looks for the **standard setter pattern** based on the field name.

---

## üîç Explanation: Does setter name need to match field name?

Yes ‚Äî **Spring follows JavaBeans convention**, which says:

> For a field `foo`, it expects a setter like `setFoo(...)`

So for `autowire="byName"`:
- Spring looks at the **property name** (i.e., the field `specification1`)
- It expects a **setter like `setSpecification1(...)`**
- If you rename the setter to `setSpecification123(...)`, Spring won‚Äôt find it ‚Üí **autowiring fails** ‚Üí **null pointer or injection issue**

---

## ‚úÖ So your setter *must* follow the naming pattern:

For this field:

```java
private Specification specification1;
```

Setter **must be**:

```java
public void setSpecification1(Specification specification) { ... }
```

Not:

```java
public void setSomethingElse(...) // ‚ùå doesn't work
```

## üìù Summary

| Element               | What Spring Needs (`byName`)                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Field name in class    | `specification1`                              |
| Bean id in XML         | `<bean id="specification1"...`               |
| Setter method          | `setSpecification1(...)`                     |

‚úÖ All three must **align by name** for `autowire="byName"` to work.
